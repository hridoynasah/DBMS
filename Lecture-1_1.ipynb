    "### 1. Database Create\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a database is the first step in setting up a data storage system. A database is a collection of related data that is organized in a way that allows easy access, management, and updating of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE database_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`CREATE DATABASE`**: This command tells the DBMS to create a new database.\n",
    "- **`database_name`**: Replace this with the name you want to give your database. The name should be unique within the server and follow the naming conventions of the DBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Database\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating a database, you need to select it to perform operations within that database. The `USE` statement selects a database as the current working database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "USE database_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "USE mydatabase;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`USE`**: This command tells the DBMS to switch to the specified database.\n",
    "- **`database_name`**: Replace this with the name of the database you want to use. All subsequent commands will be executed within this database until another `USE` command is issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Table Create\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A table is a collection of related data stored in rows and columns. Creating a table involves defining its structure by specifying column names, data types, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "    column1 datatype constraints,\n",

    "    age INT,\n",
    "    department VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`CREATE TABLE`**: This command tells the DBMS to create a new table.\n",
    "- **`table_name`**: Replace this with the name you want to give your table.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. Drop\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DROP` statement is used to delete an entire table or database. Be cautious when using this command as it permanently removes the specified object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE table_name;\n",
    "DROP DATABASE database_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "### 8. Truncate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TRUNCATE` statement is used to delete all rows from a table, but it does not log individual row deletions, making it faster than `DELETE`.\n",

    "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 30;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 25 AND department = 'HR';\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'IT';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`BETWEEN`**: This operator matches values within a specified range. The syntax is `value BETWEEN lower_bound AND upper_bound`.\n",
    "- **`AND`**: This operator combines multiple conditions, and all conditions must be true for a row to be included in the result set.\n",
    "- **`OR`**: This operator combines multiple conditions, and at least one condition must be true for a row to be included in the result set.\n"
