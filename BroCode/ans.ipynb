    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the network block for each subnet (A, B, and C) given the IP address `172.15.0.0/16` and the number of hosts required for each subnet. We will then find the Network Address, First Host Address, Last Host Address, and Broadcast Address for each subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Determine the Subnet Mask\n",
    "\n",
    "The given IP address is `172.15.0.0/16`, which means the first 16 bits are used for the network part, and the remaining 16 bits are available for subnetting and hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Bits Needed for Each Subnet\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to calculate the number of bits required for the host part of each subnet based on the number of hosts needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Subnet A (1010 hosts):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of hosts required is 1010.\n",
    "- The formula to find the number of bits needed for hosts is $2^h - 2 \\geq 1010$, where $h$ is the number of host bits.\n",
    "- Solving for $h$: $2^{10} = 1024$, so $h = 10$.\n",
    "- Therefore, the number of subnet bits needed is $16 - 10 = 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Subnet B (508 hosts):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of hosts required is 508.\n",
    "- The formula to find the number of bits needed for hosts is $2^h - 2 \\geq 508$, where $h$ is the number of host bits.\n",
    "- Solving for $h$: $2^9 = 512$, so $h = 9$.\n",
    "- Therefore, the number of subnet bits needed is $16 - 9 = 7$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Subnet C (225 hosts):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of hosts required is 225.\n",
    "- The formula to find the number of bits needed for hosts is $2^h - 2 \\geq 225$, where $h$ is the number of host bits.\n",
    "- Solving for $h$: $2^8 = 256$, so $h = 8$.\n",
    "- Therefore, the number of subnet bits needed is $16 - 8 = 8$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Assign Subnets and Calculate Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assign the subnets in descending order of the number of bits needed for the subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subnet A (6 bits for subnet, 10 bits for hosts):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subnet mask: `/22` (16 + 6 = 22)\n",
    "- Network Address: `172.15.0.0`\n",
    "- First Host Address: `172.15.0.1`\n",
    "- Last Host Address: `172.15.3.254`\n",
    "- Broadcast Address: `172.15.3.255`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subnet B (7 bits for subnet, 9 bits for hosts):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subnet mask: `/23` (16 + 7 = 23)\n",
    "- Network Address: `172.15.4.0`\n",
    "- First Host Address: `172.15.4.1`\n",
    "- Last Host Address: `172.15.5.254`\n",
    "- Broadcast Address: `172.15.5.255`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subnet C (8 bits for subnet, 8 bits for hosts):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subnet mask: `/24` (16 + 8 = 24)\n",
    "- Network Address: `172.15.6.0`\n",
    "- First Host Address: `172.15.6.1`\n",
    "- Last Host Address: `172.15.6.254`\n",
    "- Broadcast Address: `172.15.6.255`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Results:\n",

    "\n",
