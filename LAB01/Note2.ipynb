    "## **Step 1: Create a Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE SS;\n",
    "USE SS;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`CREATE DATABASE SS;`**\n",
    "  - Creates a new database named **`SS`**.\n",
    "- **`USE SS;`**\n",
    "  - Selects the **`SS`** database so that all subsequent operations happen within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **Step 2: Create the EMPLOYEE Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(\n",
    "    EMP_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    LAST_NAME VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    DEPARTMENT VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    SALARY INT NOT NULL,\n",
    "    HIREDATE DATE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`EMP_ID INT PRIMARY KEY`** → `EMP_ID` is an **integer** and the **primary key** (unique identifier for each employee).\n",
    "- **`FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL`** → Stores the first name (max 25 characters, cannot be `NULL`).\n",
    "- **`LAST_NAME VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL`** → Stores the last name (max 25 characters, cannot be `NULL`).\n",
    "- **`DEPARTMENT VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL`** → Defines the employee’s department (max 10 characters, cannot be `NULL`).\n",
    "- **`SALARY INT NOT NULL`** → Stores salary as an **integer** (must have a value).\n",
    "- **`HIREDATE DATE`** → Stores the hiring date.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Step 3: Insert Data into EMPLOYEE Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(EMP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DEPARTMENT, SALARY, HIREDATE)\n",

    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Each row represents an employee record.**\n",
    "- **For example:**\n",
    "  - Employee **`JHON DEO`** (`EMP_ID=1`) works in the **HR** department, earns **$50,000**, and was hired on **January 10, 2022**.\n",
    "  - Employee **`CHARLIE DAVINS`** (`EMP_ID=5`) works in **IT**, earns **$75,000**, and was hired on **April 7, 2017**.\n",

    "WHERE EMP_ID=3;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This updates the salary of **employee with `EMP_ID=3`** (Alice Johnson).\n",
    "- **Her previous salary was `$35,000`, and now it’s updated to `$58,000`.**\n",
    "- **`WHERE EMP_ID=3;`** ensures that only Alice’s record is updated.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE DEPARTMENT=\"IT\" AND SALARY>60000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selects **all columns (`*`) from `EMPLOYEE`** where:\n",
    "  - The department is **IT** (`DEPARTMENT=\"IT\"`)\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY!=60000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieves **all employees whose salary is NOT `$60,000`**.\n",
    "- The **`!=`** (or `<>`) operator checks for inequality.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`HIREDATE >= \"2019-01-01\"`** → Includes employees hired **on or after** Jan 1, 2019.\n",
    "- **`HIREDATE <= \"2020-01-01\"`** → Includes employees hired **on or before** Jan 1, 2020.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE \"%o%\" AND LAST_NAME NOT LIKE \"B%\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`LAST_NAME LIKE \"%o%\"`** → Finds last names that contain the letter **\"o\"** anywhere.\n",
    "- **`LAST_NAME NOT LIKE \"B%\"`** → Excludes last names that start with **\"B\"**.\n",
    "- **Matching employees:**\n",

    "\n",
