    "### **Explanation of `DECIMAL(3,2)` in SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`DECIMAL`** data type is used to store exact numeric values with a fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Understanding `DECIMAL(3,2)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`3`** → Total number of digits (Precision)\n",
    "- **`2`** → Number of digits after the decimal point (Scale)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, `DECIMAL(3,2)` means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number can have **up to 3 digits in total**.\n",
    "- **2 digits must be after the decimal point**.\n",
    "- The remaining **1 digit is before the decimal point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example Values for `DECIMAL(3,2)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Valid Values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `9.99`\n",
    "- `1.23`\n",
    "- `0.01`\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Invalid Values (Cause Errors or Rounding):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `10.00` → **Too many digits (4 total, but only 3 allowed)**\n",
    "- `123.45` → **Too many digits (5 total, but only 3 allowed)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use `DECIMAL`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- When **precision** is required, such as for **money, CGPA, or percentage values**.\n",
    "- Avoid using **FLOAT or DOUBLE** for financial calculations, as they can cause rounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **larger numbers**, you can adjust the precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DECIMAL(5,2)` → Stores numbers up to `999.99`\n",
    "- `DECIMAL(10,2)` → Stores numbers up to `99999999.99`\n"
